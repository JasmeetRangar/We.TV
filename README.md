## Getting Started

This is a self-contained app, with backend and frontend running simultaneously on two servers.

### Install Dependencies

You will need to run `npm i` in the main file as well as the `backend` and `client` servers in order to install the required dependencies

### Populate Database

Create an .env file in the `backend` folder by copying the provided .env.example

In PSQL, create a database called `final_project` with a user `labber`.
```
CREATE ROLE labber WITH LOGIN password 'labber';
CREATE DATABASE final_project OWNER labber;
```

 Then run `npm run db:reset` in the `backend` folder to populate the database.

### Run Servers

Thereafter, run the development backend server in the `backend` folder with `npm run dev`.

In another terminal window, run `npm start` to run the frontend (client) server.
